You don’t need to do much to integrate it. Its build using UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate and UIPresentationController having four types of UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning animations and many more customisations with different buttons styles and UITextField support as well

Error and Success Animations are build using CABasicAnimation and CAShapeLayer through UIBezierpath. Its fun to play with CoreGraphics.It starts slow and By the end, you’ll be able to create stunning graphics for your apps.
